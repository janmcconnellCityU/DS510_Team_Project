# Image Classification with CNN and PCA  
**DS510 Team Project – City University of Seattle**

## Overview  
This project investigates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying animal images and explores how Principal Component Analysis (PCA) might affect model performance. We are working with a small, balanced set of animal images representing three categories: cats, dogs, and birds. The goal is to compare model accuracy, training time, and loss when using raw images versus images processed with PCA.

## Data Source
We are using a subset of 150 images (50 cats, 50 dogs, and 50 birds) from the following publicly available dataset:

> Mahmoud, N. (2022). *High resolution cat-dog-bird image dataset (13000 images)* [Data set]. Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudnoor/high-resolution-catdogbird-image-dataset-13000

Image preprocessing steps such as resizing and grayscale conversion will be applied during development to standardize the input data for model training.
